            <p>I was born in Incheon, South Korea in 1995. In 2004, I visited my cousin in America who moved from Korea in 2003. I saw how his life changed for the better in America, and I wanted to live the same life. My aunt and uncle agreed to let me stay in America with them and took care of me as my guardians. I lived in Maryland ever since I decided to stay here in America. I attended University of Maryland. After graduation, I got an Analysts job for a company located near Balitmore, Maryland. I worked there for 3 years, and I recently resigned to persue a career in tech. I currently live with my significant other, and we have two Shiba Inus, Miso & Mochi. </p>

            <h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Why Coding?</h1>
            <p>I graduated with a degree in computer science, but I never pursued a career related to my degree. I struggled through college pursuing my computer science degree. So when I graduated, I struggled through the interviews which lead me to change my career field. Years later, I realized that I struggled through college because I had too many distractions around me, so it was hard for me to stay focused. Now that I am older and more mature, I feel like I am ready to properly learn computer science and try pursue a career in computer engineering. I was first introduced to coding temple by a friend who is currently enrolled in the December 19th session. He told me about his research in coding temple and how they are different from other coding bootcamps. After speaking with my friends and doing some research on my own, I thought Coding Temple would be the perfect fit for me. I never built a solid foundation while studying computer science in college. Thus, my goal in Coding Temple is to build a solid foundation that will help me better understand the world of coding.</p>
